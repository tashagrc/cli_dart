A simple command-line application in Dart to help me get comfortable with Dart syntax, especially:
- Error handling
- Concurrency (future, async, await)
- Closure

This program is a simple task management, where user can add task, see all task, and simulate run task (just using Future.delayed() and random number to simulate whether the task is succeed or fail).
